Was given a task to display some raw data:
Name
Age
Status(previous visitation) 

1st Iteration 

name = 'John Smith'
age = '20 year old'
status = 'New Patient'
print(name, age, status)

Final Iteration

while True:
    first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
    last_name = input("What is your last name? ")
    age = input("What is your age? ")
    while True:
        status = input("Have you been here before?")
        if status.lower() == "yes":
            print("Thank you have a seat")
            exit()
        elif status.lower() == "no":
            print("Please fill out New Patient Form")
            break
        else:
            print("Yes or No answer only")

    date_of_birth = input("What is your Date of Birth? (DD/MM/YYYY): ")
    address = input("What is your current residential address?: ")

    print("***Are these details correct?***")
    print("Name: ", first_name, last_name)
    print("Age: ", age)
    print("Date of Birth: ", date_of_birth)
    print("Address: ", address)
    while True:
        answer = input("Yes/No?: ")
        if answer.lower() == "no":
            break
        elif answer.lower() == "yes":
            print("Thank you. A doctor will be with you shortly.")
            exit()
        else:
            print("Yes or No answers only.")
        continue
        
Learning through taking a simple task and expanding on its capibilities seems to be a working method of study for me at the moment.

I have tasked myself today with including a conversion with some math into my previous code.

Goal: To determine the users age by their DOB input - current date ✔
IF user age is <50 continue to next step ✔
IF user age 50> ask for pension card number ✔

Potentially start to look at importing from .csv.
Create an automation task of filling out 20 forms with pre-entered user details in excel
impliment counter to track 20 > 0 and disengage once complete.
